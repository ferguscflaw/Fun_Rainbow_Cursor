# Fun Rainbow Cursor

Requirements:

- Tkinter
- OS
- SYS

# How to use

1. Click Code and then Download ZIP

2. Extract Files

3. Run rainbow.bat.

To stop it, right click it.

If that does not work (I have no idea why it would not work), do ALT + Tab to the Command Prompt and press CTRL+C without using the mouse.

If that does not work either, press CTRL+ALT+DELETE and Restart the computer.
